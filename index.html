				<h2 class="h2">The Dark Knight</h2>
			    <p class="p">"I like it a lot."</p>
				<p class="p"><i>-Taegen Robinson</i></p>
				<p class="p">The Dark knight was a great film with a perfect mix of action and suspense. Not only did it keep
				you on your toes, but it could also make you laugh. The acting duo of Christian Bale and Heath Ledger
				was enough to keep my eyes glued to screen.</p>

				<p class="p"><i>Christian Bale in back and Heath Ledger in front</i></p>
				<p class="p">The Dark Knight had both a great plot and great actors. I belive that it is the best of the Batman Trilogy
				and may be the best for a long time.</p>
				<h3 class="h3">Plot:</h3>
				<p class="p">Batman has cleaned up the streets and Gotham is near crimeless, but then The Joker shows up and things
				go bizzare. The Joker is killing people, little at a time, until the Bat reveals his identity. At a press
				conference Bruce Wayne makes a plan to reveal that he is Batman. But Harvey Dent wants the Bat to stay
				alive so he claims that he is Batman. Joker now thinks that Harvey Dent is Batman and tries to kill him
				but when the real Batman comes in he is able to take down The Joker and bring him into prison. While the
				Joker is in prison, his goons capture Harvey Dent and Rachel and trap them. The two hostages are tied to
				a bunch of oil barrels and a bomb is about to explode. Batman goes to save Rachel but got the wrong address
				and ends up saving Harvey. Although, half of Harvey's face gets lit on fire and he turns into Two Face. Joker
				escaped prison and he keeps all of Gotham hostage on two different boats. Batman sets up a system that tracks
				the Joker and stops him. Meanwhile, Commisioner Gordon's family gets kidnapped by Two Face and Batman has to
				break his one rule and kill Two Face to stop him. After that Batman runs away and isn't seen for a long time.</p>
